Hello! Here is a brief overview of the contents of this repository.
(most of this is found via the google drive folder that
I have linked in the Code & Data Supplement README file)

Early results of my research can be found in the 
'Trending_Early_results' folder, though these are
rather incomplete.

The end results of my research are in the
'DA401 Trending Analysis' folder, which has it's 
own readme for explanation.

'All Trending Data Ever Pulled' contains exactly
what it says. It's a repositiory of all of the 
data I pulled from the trending tab, ever. Some even
after I finished my analysis. The data provided elsewhere
is sufficient for analysis, but this was included for 
completeness.

'Research_Presentation_12-11-19.mp4' is a recording 
from my presentation on this work, which I included
to shed light on some of the bigger insights. The 
video quality unfortunately isn't great, so I've 
also included a copy of the powerpoint I used to
present.

'YoutubeTrendingStatAnalysis' is a statistical analysis
of the trending tab data. While most of the wrangling
was done in python, this file contains the statistical 
tests I reference in my paper. 

'Youtube Trending Analysis' is my research paper giving
an overview of my findings.
