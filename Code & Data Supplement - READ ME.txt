Github has a limit on large files, and these data sets are massive. However,
they are also required if you want to do your own exploration or run my code
yourself. Thus, I have a google drive folder that is filled with the data and
other documents, which you are welcome to download and access. You may use it
however you need to, as long as you credit me.

Enjoy! And please feel free to email me at weisz_l1@denison.edu if you have
questions about it.
